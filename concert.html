	<h1>Playing a concert</h1>
	<p>Playing a concert can be grate fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time. </p>
	<p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts.</p><h2>Copy out a set-list</h2><p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order you'll play them.</p>
	<p>Make copies for everyone.</p>
	<p>Print it <strong>BIG!</strong> so that you can still read it if it's down by your feet on the flor or if the lighting isn't very good</p>
	<h2>Remember your spares</h2>
	<p>Some instruments have parts that need to be replaced if they wear out or brak. For exampl:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>guitar strings</li>
		<li>saxaphone or clarinet reeds</li>
		<li>drumsticks</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Make a list of the spares you might need and make sure you know where they are in an emergency.</p>
	<h2>Plan where you'll be on the stage</h2>
	<p>Before you start to set up your instruments. Take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Will the drums be center stage? Or off to one side?</li>
		<li>Is there a power socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands on the right?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your instruments. It's really annoying if you have to start unplugging things and swapping places once you've begun to set the things up!</p>
	<h2>Know where you're going, know where you're on</h2>
	<p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Print out a map or set the sat nav before you set out. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unfamiliar place half-an-hour before you're due to go on stage.</p>
	<p>And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. On the night times often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get caught out!</p>
